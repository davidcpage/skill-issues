This results in long bash commands with full paths.\n\nObservations:\n- Many skills package python scripts as CLI tools with short readable names\n- Some skill repos suggest installing skills as plugins\n- Unknown if plugins enable CLI tool installation or have other advantages\n\nPreferences: Keep things simple and low-tech. Only adopt plugins if there are real advantages.\n\nQuestions to answer:\n1. How do other skills package scripts as CLI tools?\n2. What do plugins provide beyond simple skill folders?\n3. Is there a lightweight way to get short CLI commands without full plugin infrastructure?"}
{"ts":"2025-12-15T10:34:22Z","type":"note","id":"048","content":"Research findings:\n\n1. PLUGINS: Claude Code plugins provide slash commands (/hello), custom agents, hooks, and MCP servers - but NOT system CLI tools. They are distribution/packaging mechanisms, not CLI installers. Overkill for our use case.\n\n2. ANTHROPIC SKILLS: Official skills use relative paths in SKILL.md (e.g., python3 extract_text.py). Claude constructs full paths at runtime using base directory context. Same pattern we use.\n\n3. PIP INSTALLABLE: Python's pyproject.toml with console_scripts entry points creates real CLI commands (e.g., 'issues' instead of 'python3 path/to/issues.py'). Requires pip install step but is standard Python packaging.\n\n4. LIGHTWEIGHT ALTERNATIVES:\n   - Shell aliases: User adds 'alias issues=python3 /path/to/issues.py' to shell config. Per-user setup.\n   - Symlinks: Create symlinks in a PATH directory pointing to scripts\n   - Wrapper scripts: Short shell scripts that call full path\n\nKey insight: The verbose bash commands are only visible in Claude's tool calls, not typically shown to users. Token savings from shorter commands is minimal (~10-20 tokens per invocation)."}
{"ts":"2025-12-15T10:40:01Z","type":"closed","id":"048","reason":"Keeping current approach (full paths). Research found: (1) Plugins don't provide CLI tools - they're distribution mechanisms for slash commands/agents/hooks. (2) Aliases and env vars don't persist across Claude Code bash calls - each invocation is isolated. (3) No viable middle ground exists. The full-path approach is actually the most token-efficient given Claude Code's architecture."}

Expected: viewport should scroll to keep the currently focused card on screen."}
{"ts":"2025-12-18T14:54:06Z","type":"closed","id":"079","reason":"Fixed - added scroll_visible() call in _update_selection() at issues/tui.py:361-362. When a card is selected via j/k navigation, it now scrolls into view. Sessions board uses ListView which handles scrolling automatically."}
